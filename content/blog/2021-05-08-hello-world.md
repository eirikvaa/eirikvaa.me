I have been mulling over the question of creating my own website for quite some time now. Like the software developer I
am, naturally I had to explore my options. Several years ago I dipped my toe into WordPress, during my studies I got a
pretty good overview of Ruby on Rails, and I've written the classical "Hello World" program in lots of web frameworks,
so it felt quite overwhelming.

Last year I started the work on a personal website written in Ruby on Rails, because that was what I had most recently
worked on. I spent lots of time setting every thing up, with all the bells and whistles that come with the beast that is
Ruby on Rails. Then, when the complexity of it all dawned on me, I dropped it like a hot potato for never to look at it
again.

More recently, I started to look into the concept of a static-site generator (SSG) because of the need for something
simple. I found the usual suspects like Jekyll (which GitHub Pages integrates with) and Hugo. Since I'm an iOS
developer, I could have gone with [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish). Still, maybe I wanted something
more crude and old-school. So I ended up with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). It's written in Rust and has been a
blast to work with. I can dabble in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to my hearts desire and not have to think about complicated
APIs, build systems, et cetera. In the end my technology stack is made up of vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well
as Markdown as the main blog content. That stuff is for the ages. If Zola bites the dust, I'm sure I'll find a
replacement, and I'm sure that it's manageable to write a replacement. Famous last words.

I'm not really sure _why_ I'm starting to write this blog. Will I have anything interesting to bring to the larger
audience? Will people come and read? I don't really care about that last one. Anyway, here I am, finally, with my
contribution to the Internet. I'm sure _no_ single soul will read this, but at least I'm here. Here's to the way
forward!
